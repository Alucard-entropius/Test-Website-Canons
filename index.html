          <h2>The Bounty Hunter</h2>
          <p>Another cold night passed. Another hungry day for empty stomach. Although, there is still will and patience, radiating from that beast's eyes reflecting in water as mere mirror image of shiny stars in the sky. His master, as calm as he is, taking rest on his back, after full three hours of listening to every single whisper of the night.</p>
          <p>They both knew that King Bangalash will eventually come to drink from the pond and when he does, they will use every ounce of their huntering skills to grab him and collect the bounty on his head. Goblins of Pirate bay have deep pockets, so it was worth to wait this long. Who knows, tomorrow day at this hour they might be several hundreds golds richer, plan was simple, but now all they had to do is...wait.</p>

          <h2>Crime in the sand</h2>
          <p class="vertical">Terrible crime took place here. Blood is still dripping fresh through grain of sands, looking more crimson than ever. Whoever attacked this poor creature, must still be in the vicinity. Judging by these tracks, the killer must have had some kind of vehicle with him, a wagon perhaps, and these trails lead to....Gadgetzan!</p>

        <h2>Old tales followtails</h2>
        <p> Long have I yearned to visit this magnificent place. Legends about it are sung in songs, heard in World End Tavern. Myths say that not many returned alive from Karazhan, those who did, sadly, bear a scar of horrors they encountered inside. Some of them disappeared in wilderness and became scavanger with blood red eyes, some lost touch with magic almost like they got scared of it. Minority of survivors were left with will to go back one day and avenge their fallen brothers in arms, but it is said that their mind got dull, with only memories from that place and nothing else.</p>
        <p> Still, from unknown reason, heores gathered to siege battle on last resting place of the Guardian of the Azeroth. Why did i signed up to go, you may ask. Well, its simple, i...dont know. Same like every other hero i guess. Its what we do in our lives, we fight, we bleed, we heal for sake of excitment of it, for adventure, for Alliance, for Horde and for whole Azeroth. May the demons be PURGED!!!</p>
